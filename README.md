## Google Drive Backup Script (Python)
This script utilizes the Google Drive API to upload files from a local directory (backupfiles) to a folder named "BackupFolder" in your Google Drive.

## Requirements:

* Python 3
* google-auth-oauthlib library (install using pip install google-auth-oauthlib)
* googleapiclient library (install using pip install googleapiclient)
## Setup:

* Enable Google Drive API: Follow the instructions on https://cloud.google.com/ to enable the Google Drive API for your project.
* Create Credentials: Download the credentials file (credentials.json) from the Google Cloud Platform console and place it in the same directory as this script.
## Running the Script:

* Run the script from your terminal: python script.py (replace script.py with the actual filename)
## How it Works:

The script checks for a previously authorized token file (token.json).
If the token is valid, it uses it to connect to Google Drive.
If the token is invalid or doesn't exist, it prompts you to authorize the script using a web browser. This creates the token.json file for future use.
The script checks if a folder named "BackupFolder" exists in your Google Drive.
If it doesn't exist, it creates the folder.
The script iterates through all files in the backupfiles directory.
For each file, it uploads the file to the "BackupFolder" with the same filename.
The script prints a confirmation message for each successfully uploaded file.
In case of errors (e.g., network issues, authentication problems), the script displays an error message.
## Security Considerations:

* Do not share your credentials.json file publicly.
* Consider using environment variables or a secrets manager to store your OAuth credentials instead of the credentials.json file.
## Additional Notes:

This script uploads all files from the backupfiles directory. You might want to modify it to filter specific file types or add functionalities like error handling for individual file uploads.
